# Prosper Loan Data Exploratory Data Analysis

## Abstract

Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that claims to connect people who need money with those who have money to invest. In this Exploratory Data Analysis, I explore a Prosper dataset containing loan information for over a 100,000 people between the years [insert year] and [insert year].

I first sifted through the dataset, which has 82 variables, and decided which were the variables I was interested in exploring and which were outside the domain of my exploration. Then, I made a subset of the data to work with, and proceeded with my exploration.

I wanted my EDA to have a purpose, to show to those who are interested the truths about the loan data. In peer-to-peer lending, there are three main stakeholders: borrowers, lenders, and the organization itself. I have decided that I want to focus on Prosper as a stakeholder, and have designed this exploration with their interests in mind (I have not ignored the borrowers and lenders, however, and there's a lot of revelations for them as well).

The exploration is divided into 3 analytical segments in increasing order of complexity: Univariate Plots, Bivariate Plots, and Multivariate Plots, as well as a Reflection segment at the end that summarizes my experience and thoughts throughout this EDA.


## Introduction


## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Univariate Plots

Since I'm dealing with loan data, the first thing I want to check is the loan amounts being requested. Let's make a simple histogram showing just that:
